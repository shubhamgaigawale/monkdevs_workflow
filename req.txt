Appointment tracking
How to link the CRM with a Calendar service like (Calendly) for appointment tracking.
Calendly API: Calendly provides APIs to access event data, schedule events, and manage user settings.
CRM API: Our CRM system should also provide APIs to create, update, and retrieve appointment-related data.
Authentication: Both Calendly and our CRM will require secure authentication mechanisms. Typically, OAuth 2.0 is used for this purpose.
Calendly OAuth: Register your application with Calendly to get the client ID and client secret. Implement OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain access tokens.
CRM OAuth: Similarly, ensure out CRM supports OAuth 2.0 and set up the authentication to get access tokens.
Identify the data fields in Calendly (e.g., event details, invitee details) and map them to the corresponding fields in your CRM.
Ensure you have a clear mapping of which Calendly data will be stored in the CRM and how it will be represented.
E-Sign Document

Identify the data fields in your CRM (e.g., contact details, deal information) and map them to the fields required by PandaDoc/DocuSign.
Templates in PandaDoc/DocuSign: Create templates in your e-sign application with placeholder fields that will be populated with CRM data.
